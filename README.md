Hydra Router is a service-aware router which can direct HTTP and websocket message requests to registered services.

## Introduction

Using hydra router, external clients can connect to services without knowing their IP or port information. Hydra router takes care of service discovery and routing.

Additionally, hydra router can route to a website being hosted by a service.  If the router is accessed using a service name as the first url path segment and the request is an HTTP GET call then the request is routed to an available service instance.

When more than one service instance exists for a type of service, requests made through the hydra router are load balanced among available instances.

Hydra router also exposes a RESTful endpoint which can be used to query service health and presence information.  


Using Hydra, microservices can locate one another using functions such as [findService](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra#findservice), [sendServiceMessage](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra#sendservicemessage) and [makeAPIRequest](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra#makeapirequest). This all works quite well without the need for DNS or a service router.

However, when remote API requests arrive into the cloud infrastructure, determining how to **flexibly** route requests intended for upstream services becomes problematic. Consider that services may launch using different IPs and or random ports. To handle these requirements one approach involves the use of DNS, Elastic Load Balancers, and Elastic IPs. One still has to manage the machines attached to each load balancer and running multiple services on a machine further complicates the situation.


This is where Dynamic Service Registries and Routers come into play. They're designed to simplify the above requirements by being services-aware and performing intelligent routing.

Hydra-Router, using Hydra, implements a Dynamic Service Registry and Router. To do so, it uses the route information that Hydra-enabled services publish during their start-up and initialization phase. It then routes incoming messages directly to services regardless of the following challenges:

* There may be one or more service instances available to handle a specific request.
* Services might come and go, each time starting with a different IP address or port.
* Service routes might change (updated or removed) as services are added or improved.
* No changes to infrastructure would be required to address the above concerns.

So how does this work?

As noted earlier, during startup, [Hydra](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra) services perform automated registration. That's done behind the scenes when the [hydra.registerService](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra/blob/master/README.md#registerservice) method is called. When building services using [Hydra-Express](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra-express), the service's routes can be registered automatically during the initialization phase.

```javascript
hydraExpress.init(config, version, () => {
  hydraExpress.registerRoutes({
    '/v1/offers': require('./offers-v1-api')
  });
});
```

The Hydra-Router then uses the resulting service registration information to later route messages to specific services.

Services can be started on any machine on a network with or without the use of random IP ports. Because each service registers itself - it can be located by a hydra-router. This is that Dynamic Service Registry bit.

> But is it really a router? Yes! Hydra-Router uses [route-parser]() an AST-based tree parser for matching routes.

When a message is sent to the Hydra-Router it checks whether the request matches a registered route. If so, the request message is routed to an active instance of the service which registered the route. When multiple service instances exists for a service, Hydra-Router will load-balance the request to spread the load among available services.

Let's see an illustration:

![](assets/example.jpg)

In the diagram above an API request is being made to the offers service. The request arrives through an AWS Elastic Load Balancer and is directed to an instance of a HydraRouter. We can see the network topology on the left showing load-balanced hydra-routers and multiple instances of two services, the offers service and the suggestion service.

On the right is a zoomed in view, where we see that the router matches the request against registered routes. It detects a match on `v1/offers/validate/:phone/:code` and uses that information to directed the request to an offers service.

> ☕ **The key takeaway here is that this happens automatically without the need to update configuration and infrastructure. This works using Hydra's built-in service discovery and routing functionality.**

## Message Gateway
In addition to routing plain-old HTTP messages to their designated services, Hydra-Router exposes an HTTP endpoint for other incoming messages. The intended use of this is with HTTP AWS SNS callbacks and other [Webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) enabled applications.

```
/v1/router/message
```

Messages are expected to be in the [UMF message format](https://github.com/cjus/umf) and are thus routable to other microservices within a network.

> ☕ An example is provided in the included `test/apitester.paw` PAW file.

## Website traffic passthrough

Hydra-router is able to route site requests to microservices. So a microservice can serve a website in addition to responding to RESTful API calls and processing messages. This feature isn't intended for high traffic usage scenarios. Rather, this feature is intended for admin pages, status pages and other low-traffic situations. While images and other binary assets can be served - it's recommended that you use a CDN to offload requests for common static assets.

The benefits of using this feature is that you may launch services on dynamic ports on arbitrary IP's and leverage the router to find individual service instances. In this way, website requests can be handled by multiple load balanced service instances.

## HTTP proxy passthrough
Hydra-router allows you to specify routes to non-hydra services. Essentially this allows external clients to make API requests through hydra to backend servers.

To enable this functionality, simply define externals routes under the `externalRoutes` key in the configuration file. The `externalRoutes` key consists of an object of urls and their array of routes.

```javascript
:
"externalRoutes": {
  "https://someotherservice.com": [
    "[post]/api/v2/token/create",
    "[get]/api/v2/user/self.json"
  ]
},
:
```

## What other cool forward looking things might be possible?
* **Performance monitoring and Metrics**: If service messages are routed through Hydra-Router then it could record service response times and availability.
* **Token Authentication** Token based validation can be handled at the Hydra-Router level to avoid burdening down stream microservices.

## What happens when a service changes its routes?
Great question! When a service is launched, in addition to registering itself and publishing its routes, it also broadcast a message to all Hydra-Router services so they can update their route information for the newly updated service. This is done on a per service basis so other service routes remain unaffected.

## What if a service instance is unavailable?
If an active instance of a service can't be found then Hydra-Router will reply with a standard HTTP 503 (HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE) error.

## How easy it this to use?
From a developer's perspective you'd simply build a microservice using, say, Hydra-Express with as little as a dozen lines of code. And then... Hydra and Hydra-Router do the rest.

## So what's the catch?
Hydra-Router can only be used with Hydra-enabled services and can only route JSON message payloads.  However, the most common HTTP verbs are supported so you can send GET, POST, DELETE and PUT requests.

## Tests

At this time this project is setup for unit tests (in the `specs` folder) but doesn't actually include any.

There are however, API tests using the provided PAW file included in the `test` folder. To get the most out of those tests you'll need to run the sample demo services found in the [Hydra-Express demo folder](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra-express#demo).

## Optional Router API

Hydra-Router offers an HTTP API in order to expose the routes and services it's working with. This is completely optional and intended for use in debugging and monitoring scenarios.

**Router version: /v1/router/version**

Query the version of the Hydra-Router.

```shell
$ curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8000/v1/router/version"
```

Response:

```javascript
{
  "status": 200,
  "statusText": "Success",
  "result": {
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Listing routes: /v1/router/list/routes**

Used to display a list of registered routes.  Notice that the Hydra-Router (itself a service!) display's its own API.

```javascript
{
  "status": 200,
  "statusText": "Success",
  "result": [
    {
      "serviceName": "hydra-router",
      "routes": [
        "/v1/router/version",
        "/v1/router/refresh",
        "/v1/router/list/:thing",
        "/v1/router/message",
        "/v1/router/refresh/:service"
      ]
    },
    {
      "serviceName": "red-service",
      "routes": [
        "/v1/red/hello",
        "/v1/red/say"
      ]
    },
    {
      "serviceName": "blue-service",
      "routes": [
        "/v1/blue/hello",
        "/v1/blue/say"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Listing services: /v1/router/list/services**

Displays active services instances. Here we see service presence information including data points such as health and uptime. If a service crashes it would no longer appear in the response.

```javascript
{
  "status": 200,
  "statusText": "Success",
  "result": [
    {
      "serviceName": "blue-service",

      "usedDiskSpace": "82%",
      "log": [
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Listing nodes: /v1/router/list/nodes**

The list nodes request display nodes (instance of a service) which may or may not be present. This call differs from the /list/services call in that inactive instances are displayed.

```shell
$ curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8000/v1/router/nodes"
```

```javascript
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "statusMessage": "OK",
  "statusDescription": "Request succeeded without error",
  "result": [
    {
      "serviceName": "music",
      "serviceDescription": "Music service",
      "version": "0.0.9",
      "instanceID": "07eb06f8f8b346a78704a5d9e672a780",
      "updatedOn": "2016-07-27T19:38:28.773Z",
      "processID": 2209,
      "ip": "10.1.1.176",
      "port": 5000,
      "elapsed": 2
    },
    {
      "serviceName": "hydra-router",
      "serviceDescription": "Service Router",
      "version": "1.1.1",
      "instanceID": "ecf72192389ff6212bf88da03802adc9",
      "updatedOn": "2016-07-27T19:38:29.705Z",
      "processID": 2864,
      "ip": "10.1.1.176",
      "port": 5353,
      "elapsed": 1
    },
    {
      "serviceName": "auth-service",
      "serviceDescription": "Authentication service",
      "version": "0.0.10",
      "instanceID": "5b3ade39a70aba675223edc46d8c710c",
      "updatedOn": "2016-07-27T19:38:13.371Z",
      "processID": 2487,
      "ip": "10.1.1.176",
      "port": 1337,
      "elapsed": 17
    }
  ]
}
```


**Route Refresh: /v1/router/refresh/:service**

Automatically used by hydra-enabled web services when they come online.

**Example Route passthrough**

An example of sending a message through the Hydra-Router to a service called `red-service`:

```shell
$ curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8000/v1/red/hello"
```

Response:

```javascript
{
  "code": 200,
  "result": {
    "message": "Hello from red-service"
  }
}
```

You might have noticed a slight inconsistency in the response above.  Earlier examples display `status`, `statusText` and `result` JSON fields. The above example does not! The reason is because Hydra-Router returns the exact (untranslated) server response sent from the service endpoint.
