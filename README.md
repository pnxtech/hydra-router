Hydra Router is a service-aware HTTP, WebSocket and messaging gateway. It was announced at EmpireNode 2016.

HTTP and WebSocket clients can connect to Hydra Router to send messages to Hydra-based microservices. Additionally, microservices can send messages through Hydra Router back to WebSocket connected clients.

A cluster of Hydra Routers can work together to ensure that messages from microservices can be routed back to connected clients.

Hydra Router is built using the Hydra library. If you'd like to learn more about Hydra visit the [github repo](https://github.com/flywheelsports/hydra) for a list of articles and videos.
